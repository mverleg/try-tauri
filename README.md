# Tauri + SvelteKit + TypeScript

This template should help get you started developing with Tauri, SvelteKit and TypeScript in Vite.

## My local

Run with:

```
npm run tauri dev
```

Does not work due to gpu driver issue (note Electron works fine). Fewer errors with:

```
MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=radeonsi
```
